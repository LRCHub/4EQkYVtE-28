Where were you when the word went out
The spaceship landed
Everyone got high
Where were you in the second summer of love
The chemical age
Everyone got wasted
I revolve around the sun
I'm high on life, I'm overcome
Nothing else matters
Everything counts
In the here and the now
In these moments as we speak
As I live and I breathe
In circles I repeat
In circles (In circles)In circles (In circles)In circles Where were you when the stars went out
The sun went down
Everyone stayed in
Where were you when they burnt the flags
The shit hit the fan
Everyone said "man"I revolve around the sun
I'm high on life, I'm overcome
Nothing else matters
Everything counts
In the here and the now
In these moments as we speak
As I live and I breathe
In circles I repeat
In circles (In circles)In circles (In circles)In circles When tomorrow come today (when tomorrow comes)Today will be like yesterday (like yesterday)In circles (In circles)In circles (In circles)In circles I repeat in circles
I repeat in circles
I repeat in circles
I repeat in circles
I repeat in circles
I repeat in circles
I repeat in circles
