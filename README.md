[00:34.77] We couldn't turn around
[00:38.89] 'Til we were upside down
[00:42.90] I'll be the bad guy now
[00:46.96] But, no, I ain't too proud
[00:50.96] I couldn't be there
[00:55.05] Even when I tried
[00:58.97] You don't believe it
[01:02.97] We do this every time
[01:05.13] Seasons change and our love went cold
[01:09.05] Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
[01:13.05] Run away, but we're running in circles
[01:17.05] Run away, run away
[01:19.38] I dare you to do something
[01:23.37] I'm waiting on you again
[01:26.84] So I don't take the blame
[01:29.08] Run away, but we're running in circles
[01:33.05] Run away, run away, run away
[01:36.60] Let go
[01:38.97] I got a feeling that it's time to let go
[01:44.37] I say so
[01:46.81] I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
[01:51.40] You thought that it was special, special
[01:55.29] But it was just the sex though, the sex though
[01:59.33] And I still hear the echoes (the echoes)
[02:02.85] I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go
[02:08.89] Seasons change and our love went cold
[02:13.05] Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
[02:17.08] Run away, but we're running in circles
[02:21.08] Run away, run away
[02:23.40] I dare you to do something
[02:27.37] I'm waiting on you again
[02:30.85] So I don't take the blame
[02:33.05] Run away, but we're running in circles
[02:37.05] Run away, run away, run away
[02:41.17] Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
[02:44.97] It's only me
[02:46.97] What you got to lose?
[02:48.93] Make up your mind, tell me
[02:50.41] What are you gonna do?
[02:52.93] It's only me
[02:54.96] Let it go
[02:57.09] Seasons change and our love went cold
[03:01.08] Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
[03:05.01] Run away, but we're running in circles
[03:08.84] Run away, run away
[03:11.32] I dare you to do something
[03:15.37] I'm waiting on you again
[03:18.77] So I don't take the blame
[03:21.16] Run away, but we're running in circles
[03:25.08] Run away, run away, run away
